# game-of-sticks

This a game of sticks written in Python. It can be run via the terminal. Simply run python sticks.py.

The game is played by setting a number of sticks before the game begins, then each player picks between 
1-3 sticks. The loser is whoever picks up the last stick. 

The game can also be played against an AI. The AI starts by making random guesses for the number of sticks
to pick up, but each time the AI wins or loses, it amends it's potential guesses to make itself 'smarter'.
After several games, it can be quite challenging!
